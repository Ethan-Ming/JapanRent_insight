- litte note from me: i made this is for expats who don't familiar with Japan's geo-rent-transit relationship like myself to quickly familiarize themselves to local market conditions.
i've never been to Japan before.So when i go to housing site for first time i see all these location search options is just confusing because i can't picture them like native does.

Platforms like Suumo they don't offer high-level view i need to understand these relations, which is understandable since is key intel they need to stay informed in business

that's why i made this, to help expats make informed decisions


## Features ‚ú®

- **Dual Commute Visualization**: Input two key locations (e.g., workplace + hangout spot) and max commute times.
- **Living Circles Map**: Interactive Folium map showing:
  - Commute range circles from both locations
  - Overlap zones (ideal living areas)
  - Stations with median rent cost/square meter
- **Rent Statistics**: Median, quartiles, and IQR for rent prices in overlapping zones.
- **Caching System**: SQLite database caches transit times to speed up repeated queries.
- **Prefecture Filtering**: Narrow search to specific administrative regions for faster results.

## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Chrome browser (for Selenium)
- [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/) (match your Chrome version)

### Steps
1. Clone repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ethan-Ming/JapanRent_insight.git
   cd JapanRent_insight
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Set up databases (optional):
     Place tokyo_rent.db in /Dataset (you can perpere this using this tool https://github.com/Ethan-Ming/TokyoRentingBirdview/blob/main/Run_this/rent_scapping.py )
     Initial DB will be created automatically


### Usage üñ±Ô∏è
1. Launch the app:
    ```bash
    python webui.py

2. Interface guide:
    üè¢ Company/University Station: Primary commute location

    üéÆ Hangout Station: Secondary frequent destination

    ‚è±Ô∏è Commute Times: Max acceptable travel time (minutes)

    üóæ Prefecture Filter: Select regions to reduce search scope

3. Interpret results:

    Yellow overlap zones on map indicate optimal areas

    Station list shows rent cost statistics

    Larger IQR = greater rent price variability

### Limitations ‚ö†Ô∏è

-  Scope: Currently 50% of the rent info are from Tokyo

- Data Dependencies:

    - rent info cutoff at 2025-01-25, for newer knowleage requires perpare a newer tokyo_rent.db

    - Google Maps API dosen't support japan, this code use scraping which may break with UI changes

    - Performance: Initial runs may take 15-30 minutes due to transit time scraping

    - Browser Requirements: ChromeDriver must match installed Chrome version

    - Time Sensitivity: Transit times assume weekday 8AM JST departures


### Data Sources üìö
- Transit Data: Google Maps (via Selenium scraping)

- Rent Prices: [Real Estate Japan](https://realestate.co.jp/en/rent).

- Station Coordinates: OpenStreetMap.org, Google Maps

- Mapping: Folium + OpenStreetMap tiles
